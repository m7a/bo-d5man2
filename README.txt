Ma_Sys.ma D5Man2 is the new take on developing D5Man.

See existing documentation for the old D5Man
(https://masysma.lima-city.de/32/d5man.xhtml) to get an impression of what this
is intended to be able to achieve.

Like the old version, this new version is under-development. It is a second
take on the same problem with reduced features and thus a possibility to
actually get everything implemented...
